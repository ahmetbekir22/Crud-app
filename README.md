# CRUDD APP
- This Flutter project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to manage user information. It includes two main screens:

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of users fetched from an API. Users can be searched, added, edited, and deleted. Additionally, users can update the API key used for fetching data and navigate to a web page.

 - **User info form**: Allows users to add or edit user information including name and birthdate. The form validates input and saves user data using an API service.

 
### FEAUTURES:
- Fetch users from an API and display them in a list.
- Search users by name.
- Add new users with a name and birthdate.
- Edit existing users' information.
- Delete users from the list.
- Update API key used for fetching data.
